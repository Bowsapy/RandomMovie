# RandomMovie
This Python desktop app, built with tkinter, helps you find a random movie based on your chosen filters.
Simply select a genre, year range, and original language, download the movie database using your The Movie Database (TMDb) API key, and then pick a movie from the filtered list. The selected movie will be displayed in the app and a webpage to stream it will open automatically.
